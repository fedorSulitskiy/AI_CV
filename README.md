# AI CV Helper Project
Today we, graudate software engineers, have to apply to dozens of jobs to get a chance at an interview. We have to put up with recruiters using software which
rejects applications upon not spotting keywords in CVs. We have to show commitment by tailoring our CVs to vacancies. However it is a painful task when done for
so many applications.

Hence I made this simple tool to assist people like myself in this task! It allows one to "tailor" their CV to the job vacany, and do it en masse!
